# FileSorter

The script accepts 1 argement as filepath and sorts the files based on file extensions. e.g. c:/XYZ/ contains 5 files named file1.pdf, file2.docx, file3.exe, file4.pdf and file5.docx. 

The script will create 3 folders named pdf, docx, exe and will move file1.pdf and file4.pdf in pdf. Similarly, it will move other other files to respective folders too.
